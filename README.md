A lot of customers utilise e-banking to pay for their online purchases of goods. There are e-banking websites that, frequently for malevolent purposes, request users to provide confidential material including login, password, and credit card details. A phishing website is one that offers this kind of e-banking service. One of the essential software services for Internet communications is the web service. A number of security risks to web services on the Internet include web phishing.

Web phishing dangers that are often encountered include:

Through the use of a fake website, a practise known as web phishing, the goal is to get sensitive data including usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. Damage to property and information leakage are the results. Numerous scams have the potential to target large enterprises.
Applying a machine-learning algorithm to identify phishing websites is the major goal of this guided project.

We suggested a clever, adaptable, and successful method that is based on applying classification algorithms in order to identify and anticipate e-banking phishing websites. We used classification methods and approaches to extract the phishing datasets' eligibility criteria and interpret them.

The e-banking phishing website may be identified using various key features, including the URL and domain identification, security and encryption requirements, and the overall phishing detection rate. Once a user completes an online transaction and pays through an e-banking website, our system uses a data mining algorithm to determine if the e-banking website is legitimate or a phishing website.
